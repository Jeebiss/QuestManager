'Find the Instigator':
  Type: Quest
  Description:  This is an extension to the Skeleton Invasion quest.  The
                  premise is that stupid skeletons could not possibly have
                  put together such detailed plans about the city, or how
                  to lead such an invasion.
  Chapters:
    'Find the Instigator':
      #
      # The requirement to start this chapter, and, thus, this quest, is that
      # the user has completed the "Return the Plans" chapter of the "Skeleton
      # Invasion" quest.  This is how inter-quest dependencies are created.
      # Quest Chapter requirements can branch off of completing any other
      # quest's chapter.

      Requirements:
      - QUEST FINISHED 'Skeleton Invasion.Return the Plans'

      #
      # The introduction to this quest defines a custom item named "Misplaced
      # Skeleton Commander Note" that the user has to pickup.  It will be spawned
      # when a user walks within 5 blocks of a particular location.  It can only
      # happen when the user is on this quest's chapter.
      #
      Introduction:
      - CHAT "<PLAYER.NAME>, word has spread through the town of your
        bravery in saving the town.  But rumors have spread like wildfire
        that there is an instigator... a TRAITOR... in our midst that
        was the root cause of the trouble.  You need to track him or her
        down and report back to me so that we can arrest them and put them
        away so that no further harm can come.  Perhaps you should snoop
        around in the local taverns and see what turns up."
